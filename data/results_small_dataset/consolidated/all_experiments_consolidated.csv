How do water cycles work and how do the elements affect the Earth?

Water flows in and out through oceans for about 5 days per year. Then the water turns to ice crystals in the water around it, becoming concentrated, which makes it difficult to separate.

They are an active, ongoing process of evolution. As such, the water cycles are the most significant and important",60,0.7,0.9491525423728814,0.9827586206896552,0.0172413793103448,0.1488095238095237,0.6107142857142858,0,16.704273223876953,0.2608695652173913,4.015871047973633,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
