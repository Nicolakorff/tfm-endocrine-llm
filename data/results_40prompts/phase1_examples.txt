--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the main differences between classical and quantum physics?

A classical system is one that uses some of classical physical principles and therefore can be simulated only once.

A quantum system uses the quantum phase theory and the spin-actuated quantum mechanics.

Prompt: What are the main differences between classical and quantum physics?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the main differences between classical and quantum physics?

Quantum states can be easily divided. Classical physics is essentially pure-state systems in which the electrons are constantly in an extremely entangled state and it isn't necessary for them to go there without violating the classical version of reality. What you see in traditional physics is the transition where things are going
